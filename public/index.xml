      <description>In this short analysis i was curious about the connection of countries state of global happiness and their alcohol consumptions. Are people more or less happy in countries where a lot of alcohol is consumed? Do happy countries have different alcohol consuming habits?
To answer this question i am investigating two datasets available online in kagle.
One of the datasets is the World Happiness Report which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.</description>
